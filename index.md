## Info

Pokewalk is an app to add some traveled distance you your google fit account, therfore it can be used to add distace traveled to games such as PoGo.

Pokewalk is available for free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.binarygraft.pokewalk).
The app contains Ads


### Important

The app, like other similar apps, has no direct interaction with PoGo as it merely adds distance to Google Play services.
This said, the app is NOT ban proof, is NOT 100% safe and does not guarantee in ANY way that there won't be consequences.
In general you should never believe in similar claims as it's impossible for anyone to make such statement.
I don't take any responsibility for the app usage or any bans or warning that may happen.



### Requirements
The app requires a device running Android 4.4 or above and a google account. If you are using the app for PoGo you need to use the same account you linked.

The app does not require you to install Google Fit, but you can use it to check if the app is working while waiting for PoGo to sync.

## Guide

Using the app is really simple

* Open the app and login with your google account
* Pick a distance using the slider, you can see how much time will be necessary to log such distance just below
* If you are on a hurry, toggle the run mode for quicker results
* Press one of the "walk" buttons to log your run (you may have to watch an ad)
* If everything went right a popup will say "Success!" and the "Last successful run" time will be updated

* Wait for the estimated time, you'll receive a notification when the run is over. You can close the app in the meantime
* * The first time using the app you may want to check on Google Fit if the distance has been fully added to your account once you receive the notification

* Wait for PoGo to sync with Google fit services

## FAQ

Here's a collection of the most common question and their relative answers about the Pokewalk app.

### What's the difference with Defit? Why is it useful?
Pokewalk has been created to be quick to use and painless.
Unlike Defit it does not have to stay open in the background, hence, you'll probably have less trouble on devices with annoying battery savers that close apps when you don't want to.
In the context of PoGo the app has been reported to be useful to reach the 50Km weekly goal or especially to hatch eggs thanks to the notifications you can receive after a certain distance has been reached.

### Can I use Pokewalk while playing
Yes you can, the distance you pick will be added over time even while playing. 

### Do I have to leave Pokewalk open for it to work?
No, after you add some distance you can close it and don't worry about it

### Is Google Fit required to use the app?
No, Google Fit is not required. You can use it to check if the distance has been added.

### How can I check if the distance is being added?
You can install the Google Fit app and press on the "distance traveled" amount, a small graph for distance traveled over time will open

### I added some distance but the app seems to not be working / the distance added is not being considered
There are various reasons why this could happen, try these steps to find the problem:
- Wait: the distance is added over time so you'll need to wait both for the distance to be logged, and for PoGo to pick up the new distance traveled. Even if you get the notification that the full distance has been added it doesn't mean that PoGo has synced yet.
- Check with the Google Fit app if the distance has been added atleast to your google account. If it has been added there, you'll just need to wait for PoGO to sync it.
- Check if PoGo, Google Fit or Google Services have the location permission enabled
- Check that you are using the same google account for Pokewalk and PoGo
- Check that your google account is a @goooglemail account, if it is you can update it to @gmail by clicking "switch to @gmail.com" in the "Accounts" tab in your Gmail Settings (it will only show up if you're eligible to change your address.)
Google fit services are known to not work with @googlemail accounts
- Check if Google Play Services is updated, if so try and clear its cache
- Check if you are using an ad-blocker
- Check if any kind of firewall is blocking your requests
- Check that you are not using any kind of battery saving apps for PoGo or Pokewalk, also things like "power saving mode" on Samsung devices
- Make sure your phone's clock is set automatically, having it manually set causes issues with the syncing process
- In the game try to go in Settings > Advanced Settings > Refresh Game Data
- If you tried everyting, and apps like Defit do not work either, there's a chance that the problem is on Google's side. It occurred to me that for a couple hours on a random day distance was not being added
If you can't get it to work please contact the support from the play store page.

### Can I use Pokewalk with multiple accounts?
Yes, you will find an option to switch account

### Does Pokewalk need to be on the same device as PoGo?
No it does not. It will work as long as the same google account is used. In fact you can even have PoGo on iOS while using Pokewalk on an android device

### Notifications are not showing up on the lockscreen of my Xiaomi device
On Xiaomi devices you will need to allow the lock screen notifications for Pokewalk from Settings > Notifications > Lock Screen Notifications.

### What's my user ID?
Pokewalk requires you to login with your google account, if you paid attention though, it does not ask you permission to access your email, name or other personal information. That's cause we don't need it!
Instead of asking permission to access this information for no valid reason, we just show you a unique anonymous identifier for your google account.
This way if you use multiple accounts you know which one you're currently using!

### Old PW version
### What's the run switch?
The run switch reduce the time it takes to cover a certain distance, once you activate it you can see the time estimate for a run update.

### What are "From this moment" and "Just before now"? 
This option allows to add some distance traveled in the near future or near past.
For example, if you add 1km "just before now", it's like tellig the app "Hey, I walked 1km in the past 10 min, log this".
If you add 1km "From this moment", it's like telling the app "Hey, I'll be walking 1km in the next 10 min, log this".

"Just before now" only works in situations when you know that PoGo has not completed a sync recently. If PoGo has just synced and you add some distance it will just get ignored.
